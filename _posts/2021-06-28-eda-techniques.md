*If you are going to find out anything about a dataset,  
then you must understand the data first and try to gather as many
insights from it*

### What's an EDA ?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets 
and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.
 
### Importance OF EDA
* It helps in looking up data before making any assumptions.  
* It can help ***identify obvious errors***, as well as better understand existing patterns within the data.
* It helps in ***detecting outliers or anomalous events***, find interesting relationships among the variables / features.
* Deliver ***data-driven insights*** to business stakeholders

### Processes Involved In EDA

* Data Collection  
* Data Cleaning
* Data Pre-processing   
* Data Visualization 

### Data & Its Types  
The term "data" was first used to denote "transmissible and storable computer information" in 1946 
[(source)](https://www.etymonline.com/word/data). 

#### Broadly  Categorized Under Three Umbrella
* Structured - ( *For Example* : Customer Information stored in RDBMS.. )
* Semi-Structured - ( *For Example* : Json & XML Document, Emails, EDI.. )
* Unstructured - ( *For Example* : Images, Audio Files, Video Files.. )

In this post **we will focus on structured data**, where I would walkthrough a 
systemic approach to quickly show latent statistics from one of the dataset.

**Structured Data Types** can further be categorized into 2 types :

1.) Categorical Data :  Any data that is not a number. The rules of arithmetic
do not apply.

{: .box-note}
***Nominal*** - It comes from the latin word "nomen" which means Name.  
It represents Simple Naming System.  
*For Example* - **Country Names**  
***Ordinal*** - Data in which their order matters.  
*For Example* 
Competitive Ranking 1,2,3..  
Happiness Rating On Scale Of 10  
***Binary*** - Data which can have only 2 values.  
*For Example* - Yes or No

2.) Quantitative Data : Data which can be represented in form of numbers.
The rule of arithmetic operations can be applied on them.  

{: .box-note}
***Discrete*** - Numbers which have a logical end to them.    
*For Example* -  Interval, Days in a Month.  
***Continuous*** - Numbers which don't have a logical end to them.  
*For Example* - Heights.
