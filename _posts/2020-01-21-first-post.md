*  **Thou shalt always think about readability of code:** In short readability boils down to "*I like reading it*". Make sure whatever code you are writing, 
   it is easy to follow logically. Always keep in mind basic principles like [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) which stands for Don't Repeat Yourself.
   Also known as **DIE** Duplication is Evil.
 
*  **Thou shalt always provide meaningful variable names:** A proper variable name depicts its purpose but not its value.

*  **Thou shalt not steal code from others:**

    Be careful when using someone else's code. If you copy and paste the code into your program, 
    please make sure that you aren't violating any contract as mentioned in the licenses.

*  **Thou should run the unit, functional and (or) integration tests (as appropriate) before making a commit:** Don't forget to run unit tests and integration tests
   before making a commit. Testing before you commit is simply an added layer of protection. 
   It helps you to find errors, and bugs more quickly, before they are pushed to your server. Hence helps in improving code quality. 

*  **Thou shalt not commit secrets to open source code repositories:**

*  **Thou shalt heed Java warnings in IntelliJ or Eclipse  - eg unused code, declarations that could be moved closer to scope etc:** 
     
*  **Thou shalt not leave the build Red and go home:** 
  
*  **Thou shalt not checkin on Red build:**

*  **Thou shalt push shorter and frequent commits:**   
  
*  **Thou shalt ensure pipeline ( all stages of pipeline including tests ) is green:**   
  
*  **Thou shalt revert the commit in case it fails and fix is going to take longer:**   
  
*  **Thou shalt take feedback constructively and not shy away from sharing constructive feedback with your colleagues:**

*  **Thou shalt update the dev Wiki (Confluence) with any new patterns, approaches, techie things of interest:**   
  
*  **Thou shalt callout, discuss and share the high level design decisions for all the critical and major functional areas before implementation:**  
    
*  **Thou shalt keep JIRA and Confluence updated:** :smile:

*  **Thou shalt agree to meet each quarter & have a constructive conversation about our performance against these guiding principles and identify areas of improvement**
